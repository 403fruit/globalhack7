# Ellis #

Named after the famous Ellis Island, Ellis helps immigrants and refugees by
connecting them with others in their area, immigrants and natives alike, to
share knowledge and build communities to ensure their transition to life in
the United States is as smooth as possible.

Users can create profiles describing their unique situations, skills, and
interests, and Ellis will find others willing to share or looking for help.

The goal of Ellis is to build and strenghten immigrant communities by removing
roadblocks, sharing knowledge, and making connections that will last a lifetime.
